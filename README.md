<h2>Project Overview: TfL Cycling Engagement</h2>

<p>As the project lead for the TfL cycling engagement project, I managed a team of six over a six-week period, balancing leadership responsibilities with my own data analysis tasks.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 2018, the Mayor of London launched the Transport Strategy to transform urban mobility and reduce car dependence. The Mayor set priorities for improving cycling infrastructure and promotion, including street improvements, safety measures, and accessibility for all demographics.</p>

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>This project, commissioned by ThoughtWorks (TW), aims to identify strategies and investment opportunities to increase cycling engagement in London, with a target of achieving an 80% increase in cycling uptake.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The analysis leverages data to guide decision-making, assess the effectiveness of current strategies, and provide specific recommendations for high-impact, cost-effective interventions.</p>
